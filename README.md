# ProjectT
To begin press the play button in Unity(top middle of the screen)
Once you are in play mode you can take the following actions:
  hold control and left click to duplicate a character
  click and drag to move a charcter
  press space to begin the action
Once space has been pressed characters will begin to fight. Charcters not on the board will not move
You can edit the charcter stats by clicking on them. Attack, health and armor are the ones that matter, as well as the length of the Capsule Collider(this defines their range)
The large yellow figures are currently functioning as bases, they have high health and do not move
