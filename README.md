# Project T

To begin press the play button in Unity. (Top middle of the screen.)

Once you are in play mode you can take the following actions:
* hold control and left click to duplicate a character
* click and drag to move a character
* press space to begin the action

Once space has been pressed characters will begin to fight. Characters not on the board will not move. 

You can edit the character stats by clicking on them. Attack, health, and armor are the ones that matter, as well as the length of the Capsule Collider, which defines their range. 

The large yellow figures are currently functioning as bases, they have high health and do not move.
