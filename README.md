# Project T

To begin, press the play button in Unity. (Top middle of the screen.)

Once you are in play mode, you can take the following actions:
* hold control and left click to duplicate a character
* click and drag to move a character
* press space to begin the action

If you press space, the characters will fight. Characters not on the board will not move. 

You can edit each character's stats by clicking on them. Attack, health, armor, and the length of the Capsule Collider are the ones that matter. The Capsule Collider defines a character's range. 

The large yellow figures are bases, they have high health and do not move.
